Dominic A. Sirianni, PhD, is a postdoctoral research associate at the
University of Richmond, working to mentor undergraduate researchers in the
exciting field of computational and quantum chemistry.  Dominic earned his PhD
in Theoretical Chemistry from Georgia Tech in May 2020, where his thesis
focused on understanding the interactions between atoms and molecules through
the lens of quantum mechanics.  Dominic's research has yielded several
peer-reviewed publications, as well as contributed talks and posters at
prestigious regional and national conferences, and he was awarded the 2020
Larry S. O'Hara Fellowship as the top doctoral student in the College of
Sciences at Georgia Tech.
